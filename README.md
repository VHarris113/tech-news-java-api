## Description
It is a convenient Java run application that allows the user to sign-up, log-in, post, comment, and even vote on their posts about interesting articles within the tech community. The main technology used in this application is Java, which was a challenge. It was hard to use Intellij for the first time and attempting to create the entirety of the website itself. It was great first time practice that I'm glad I was able to accomplish. One of the biggest challenges for me was trying to get the server to connect properly with all the templates, repos, models, and controllers. It was a lot more than the usual JS or React applications that I'm used to.
